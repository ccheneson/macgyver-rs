At work, we have around 20 microservices.

Sometimes, `kubectl` outputs is just not what we want e.g. we want to display the image name instead of the pod name.

`macgyver-rs` is a CLI tool that interacts with k8s (like `kubectl`) with a customize output.

This project is in a working state, will be used as playground and will (hopefully) evolve and improve.
